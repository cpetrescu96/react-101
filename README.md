`State` describes the current condition of an object or system at a particular point in time.

In React, components can have their own internal state (memory) that can change based on user actions or changes in external data. When a component's state changes, React updates the user interface to reflect the new state.

In React, this component-specific memory is called `State`.

### What is a Hook in React

üí° Hooks are special functions available only during React rendering that allow you to "hook into" various features of the React library and are intended for use in functional components. For example, the `useState` hook provides components access to React state.

üí° Custom hooks can be created, allowing you to move component logic into functions that can be reused.

üí° Hook names (functions) always start with the word `use`, such as `useEffect`, `useState`, `useReducer`, including for custom hooks, so React understands that a special hook function will be used.

üí° Hooks can only be called at the top level of components (or custom hooks), i.e., directly inside a React functional component. Hooks cannot be called inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions.

### Declaring State Variables using useState

The `useState` hook provides two entities:

- A state variable to store data between renders of the component.
- A state-setting function to update the variable and instruct React to re-render the component.

To add a state variable, import `useState` from React at the top of your file:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```

Then, place the state variable declaration at the beginning of your functional component as a call to the `useState` hook.

When you call `useState`, you inform React that you want this component to remember something.

```jsx
export const Counter = () => {
  // Call the hook at the beginning of the functional component
  const [counterValue, setCounterValue] = useState(0);
  // ...
};
```

Call the hook at the beginning of the functional component [array destructuring](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment) allowing you to read values from an array. 
The array returned by useState always contains exactly two elements: the state variable and the state-setting function.

By convention, this pair is called const [something, setSomething]. You can name it anything, but conventions aid understanding across projects.

üí° The only argument to useState is the initial value of your state variable.

To change the state (set a new value for the counterValue variable), you need to call the setCounterValue function and pass the new value as an argument:

```jsx
// The new value for the counterValue variable will be 3
setCounterValue(3);
```

### How useState works

1. Your component is rendered for the first time. Since you passed `0` to `useState` as initial
   value of `counterValue`, it will return `[0, setCounterValue]`. React remembers that `0` is the last state value.
2. You update the state. When the user clicks the button, it calls `setCounterValue(counterValue + 1)`. Current
   the value of `counterValue` is `0`, then `setCounterValue(1)` is executed. This tells React that `counterValue` is now
   is `1`, and starts another render (re-rendering the component).
3. Second render of your component. React still sees `useState(0)`, but since React remembers that you set `counterValue` to `1`, it returns `[1, setCounterValue]` instead.

Thus, the component can remember data (component memory) between renders.

### Providing Multiple State Variables to a Component
You can have as many state variables of any type in one component.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export const Gallery = () => {
  const [counterValue, setCounterValue] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  //...
};
```

It is recommended to have multiple state variables if their state is not related, such as `counterValue` and `showMore` in
this example. But if you find yourself frequently changing two state variables together, it might be easier to combine
them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it is more convenient to have one state variable containing
object than a state variable for each field.

Internally, React stores an array of state pairs for each component. It also maintains the current pair index, which
set to 0 before rendering. Every time you call `useState`, React gives you the following
a couple of states and increases the index.

An example of how `useState` works from the inside can be found on the official documentation page - [Giving a component multiple state variables](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory#giving-a-component-multiple-state-variables).

### State is isolated and private

The state created with `useState` is isolated and private to each rendered component
on the screen. This means that each component has its own state, and this state cannot be accessed
directly from other components or modified by other components.

If you render the same component twice in different places, then in both cases each component will have
their completely isolated state and they will not be connected to each other in any way, each copy will receive its own
state.

### Bottom line

- Use a state variable when a component needs to "remember" some information between renders
  component.
- State variables are declared by calling the `useState` hook.
- Hooks are special functions that begin with the word `use`. They allow you to "tap into" such features
  React as a state (State).
- Calling hooks, including `useState`, is only allowed at the top level of a component or other hook.
- The `useState` hook returns a pair of values: the current state and a function to update it `[something, setSomething]`.
- The `useState` hook can contain any data structure as a value.
- You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them in order.

The finished example with the application is located in `src`.

To run the example with a ready-made application, run the commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cpetrescu96/react-101.git

git checkout hook-use-state

npm install

npm run dev
```
